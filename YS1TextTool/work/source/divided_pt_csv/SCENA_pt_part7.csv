691,"I can get you something to\ndrink anyway, though, if\nyou'd like. What say you?",要不要喝一杯再走？
692,"It's nice and quiet here with no\ncustomers, but it does start to\ntake its toll after a time.","没有客人是很轻松啦，\n问题是清闲过头了……"
693,"How was Minea? If not for the\nmonsters, we could go spread our\nwings and explore a little, easily.","米内亚镇的情况怎么样？\n要是没有魔物的话，\n我也想要去那里玩的。"
694,"I'm so very bored... If you should\nfind anything of interest, please,\nbe sure to tell me all about it!","啊……好闲啊。\n你有什么趣闻的话，\n一定要告诉我哦。"

701,"Hmm? What's wrong? Did\nyou need something?","嗯？……怎么了？\n找我有什么事吗？"
702,"One of our jobs is to\nescort people between\nplaces like Minea and\nZepik Village.","自卫队的工作之一\n是把镇上的人护送到\n米内亚或塞皮克村去……"
703,"The monsters tend to avoid me, yet\nalways attack the villagers I'm\nescorting, from behind, without\nfail. Cunning bastards...","有时候魔物偏偏不找我，\n专挑后面被护送的弱者下手。\n都是些狡滑到令人害怕的家伙。"

710,"It's tedious work, but\nSOMEBODY has to keep\nwatch over the city. And\nthat somebody is me!","虽然无聊，但是为了镇上的安全，\n总得有人来做这份工作嘛。\n……片刻都不能大意。"
711,"The monsters pretty much never hit\nus here. But the fact remains, they\neasily COULD. You can never tell\nwhat they're thinking!","最近没有发生过魔物袭击事件。\n可是只要我们一放松，\n它们就会看准时机发动攻击……\n就好像有人在背后操纵着一样。"
712,"Our little port town isn't behind\nwalls like Minea, so it falls on us\nto keep the place safe. In a sense,\nit's like WE'RE Barbado's walls.","这个镇没有像米内亚那样的城墙，\n只能靠我们的自卫队来保护了。"

726,"I need to look for\nsomething I can do to\nhelp around here, myself!","我也应该去找找看有没有\n对镇上有帮助的事情可做的……"

739,"I'm sure my family's doing\nwell...but I still worry\nabout my dear grandchild.","希望他们都身体健康。\n……只是，\n我还是放心不下我那孙子。"
741,"Slaff is working hard to keep\nthe town safe...but in the end,\nhe may just be kidding himself.","虽然斯拉夫在很用心地保障镇上的安全，\n可是临时抱佛脚也没用啊……"
742,"Rather than live in fear of a\nmonster attack, wouldn't it be\nbetter for everyone in Barbado\nto move to Minea?","与其生活在魔物入侵的恐惧中，\n不如干脆让所有巴尔巴多的人\n都搬到米内亚去不是更好吗？"
743,"However hard we try, we're\nsimply no match for the monsters.\nIf they attack us, we're done for!","不管再怎么努力，\n终究是敌不过魔物的……"

745,"You went to Minea? Are you daft?!\nThere are monsters everywhere!","听说你去过米内亚了？\n你……你不怕魔物吗？"
746,"There was once a village near the\nmine, but I hear it was razed to\nthe ground by the monsters.","矿山附近的一个村子\n就是被魔物摧毁的……"
747,"How is that you and Slaff can\nbe such brave men? Do you just\neat a lot of fiber, or what?!","不管是你，还是斯拉夫……\n为什么你们都能这么积极乐观呢？"
750,"This is the town where I was\nborn and raised. It's my home!\nTo even consider leaving this\nplace...","这里是我出生长大的地方……\n要是可以，我并不想搬到其他地方去。"
751,"But my child's safety is\nparamount. So perhaps\nMinea, with its city wall,\nreally is the place to be!","但是为了家里的孩子……\n或许住在有城墙的米内亚\n会比较安全吧？"
752,"Our Danny certainly wants to go to\nMinea. He's already tried to make\nthe journey, in fact...with the\nneighbor's little girl in tow!","我儿子真是的，\n竟然想带邻居家的女孩\n到米内亚去。"

762,"Their meat is absolutely delicious,\nbut they're real easy prey for\nmonsters. So we raise 'em here,\nwhere nothing can hurt 'em but us!","肉质细腻美味。\n它们也会成为魔物的猎物，\n所以就这样圈养在镇里面了。"

784,"Minea's protected by city walls,\nso it's a safer place to be.","米内亚镇有坚固的城墙，\n我觉得比这里安全。"
785,"On the other hand, I hear they\nhave some serious crime problems\nthere. Lots of thievery...","不过现在又有传言说，\n米内亚镇频遭盗贼骚扰……"
786,"You know what? I trust our militia.\nThey look after us, Minea, and even\nZepik! They're good people.","还是自卫队比较可靠。\n他们会护送民众到\n米内亚或塞皮克村去。"
787,"But we can't just take them for\ngranted. I mean, you just never\nknow, right?","但也不能开口就要他们帮忙的。\n那样做不大好，对吧？"
788,"But just between you and me...\nI feel like the men here tend to\nperpetuate violence just to satisfy\ntheir own sense of machismo!","这话我只和你说哦……\n你不觉得看到男人\n为你冒着生命危险……"
