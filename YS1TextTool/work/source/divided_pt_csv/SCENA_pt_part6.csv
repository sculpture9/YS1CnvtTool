﻿541,"There we are. Try not to strain\nyourself. You need your strength!","瞧，这样就好了。\n以后不要太乱来啦。\n必须要认清自己的实力。"
542,"What? I just treated you. I'm not senile\nyet, you know!","什么啊？\n刚刚才帮你治疗过吧。\n你怎么痴呆得比我都早了呢。"
543,"I'm sorry, we're all out of the Red\nDigitalis plant we need to make healing\npotions.","不好意思。\n药的原料毛地黄已经没有了。"
544,"Dr. Klaus in Minea should have some\nextra, though. You should go see him.","米内亚的克劳斯医院里\n应该还有不少库存，\n你去那里帮我拿一些过来吧。"
545,"Ah, you're going out again? Take care of\nyourself, Adol!","是吗，你又要出去了吗？\n不要太勉强自己哦。"
550,"Why, if it isn't Adol! You okay to be\nmoving around like that?","嗨，亚特鲁！\n你已经可以活动了吗？"
551,"Every time I stopped by, you were sound\nasleep. You must have been exhausted!","我每次去病房探望你时，你都在睡觉。\n好像很累的样子。"
552,"So...heard any murmurings overseas about\nEsteria?","对了，外面的人是怎么看待\n艾斯塔里亚的？\n"
553,"I'd love to know what people are saying\nabout us!",说来听听吧。
554,"Adol told Slaff he'd heard the land was\ncursed.","亚特鲁告诉他，\n人们传言艾斯塔里亚\n是一个被诅咒的国家。"
555,"...Cursed, huh? That's not really true,\nbut it's also not TOO far off.","……被诅咒的国家啊。\n虽然不完全准确，但也差不多了。"
556,"Guess we can't count on any support from\nthe outside, if they think we're cursed\nover here. We've gotta take action!","果然还是不能指望外面的人。\n只能靠自己来想办法了……"
557,"Anyway, I don't know a whole lot, but\nI'll gladly answer any questions I can.\nAsk away!","好吧，就当做是交换吧，\n我会告诉你我所知道的，怎么样？"
559,"Hey, Adol. You're looking well! How are\nyou adjusting to Esterian life?","嗨，亚特鲁，你好像完全康复了嘛。\n还有什么想知道的吗？"
561,Anything on your mind?,你想了解什么？
562,Barbado,巴尔巴多
563,Esteria,艾斯塔里亚
564,The Stormwall,岚之结界
565,The Militia,自卫队
566,Nothing,没什么想问的
567,"Barbado is the only port town in\nEsteria.",巴尔巴多是艾斯塔里亚唯一的港口镇。
568,"It used to just be a small fishing\nvillage until silver was discovered\nnearby. Then, it boomed overnight!","很久以前，这里只是个荒芜的小渔村。\n自从在艾斯塔里亚发现了银之后，\n巴尔巴多就发展成了贸易港口。"
569,"...But ever since that Stormwall\nshowed up, no ships can get in or\nout. Our exporting days are over!","……但是自从岚之结界出现后，\n就再也没有船只能进来这里，\n银也无法出口了。"
570,"So now, it's just a fishing village\nagain. For the time being, anyway.",于是又衰退回了原来的渔村模样……
572,"At least everyone got some money from\nall the silver trade while it lasted,\nI guess!","唉，因为银而繁荣的时候，\n每个人都在为了赚钱而奔波。\n也许这已经是最好的结果了。"
573,Esteria is a small island country.,艾斯塔里亚是个小小的岛国。
574,"There are only a few towns here.\nBarbado, the walled city of Minea,\nand Zepik Village in the mountains.","有人居住的地方，也就是\n这个巴尔巴多和被城墙围着的米内亚镇，\n剩下的只有山脚下的塞皮克村了。"
575,"Not long ago, there was also a town\ncalled Rastin, but it got wiped out\nby monsters after the mine closed.","不久之前还有个拉斯汀村，可是……\n受到银矿山封闭以及魔物袭击的影响，\n现在已经没有人住在那里了……"
576,"The place where I found you is called\nWhitehorn Beach.","你漂流到的地方，\n被称为『白号角沙滩』。"
577,"Mother-of-pearl pieces wash ashore\nthere. Great place for a stroll,\nsave for the monsters everywhere!","那是个像是铺了层珍珠贝碎片一样\n纯白美丽的沙滩。\n要不是有魔物出没，那里可是散步的好地方。"
578,"The walled city of Minea is to the\nnorth, beyond the plains. Good starting\npoint for any adventure.","从这个镇往北走，在草原的前方，\n有座被城墙包围着的叫做米内亚的小镇。\n如果有什么事要去办，可以在这先整顿好装备。"
580,"What else... Oh, yeah! Darm Tower!\nEsteria's claim to fame-- sort of.","还有就是，对了……\n艾斯塔里亚最有名的就是『达姆之塔』了。"
581,"What else... Oh, yeah! Darm Tower!\nEsteria's claim to fame. No doubt\nyou saw it on your way here.","还有就是，对了……\n艾斯塔里亚最有名的就是『达姆之塔』了。\n你来这里之后也有看到过吧？"
582,"It just seems to kiss the clouds,\ndoesn't it? On clear days, you can\nsee it all the way from Promalock!","那是座高耸入云的巨大古代遗迹。\n听说天气好的时候，从海对面的\n普罗玛洛克港也能看到它。"
583,"There are other touristy spots, but\nthey've been infested with monsters\never since the Stormwall showed up.","唉，这里的景点还是挺多的，\n可惜自从岚之结界出现后，\n魔物就开始到处游荡了。"
585,"Damned thing really made life difficult\nfor us.","外面危险得要命，\n根本没法到处走动了。"
586,"It appeared...let's see, about six\nmonths or so ago.",那是……大约在半年前吧。
587,"The first storm started on a night when\nsome trade ships carrying silver set out\nfrom Barbado.","一艘运载着银的商船\n在离开巴尔巴多港的那天晚上，\n……遇到了强烈的暴风雨。"
588,"Buffeted by the storm, the ships were\nobliterated. Washed ashore on Whitehorn\nBeach the next morning.","船舶被卷入了暴风雨中，受损严重，\n最后被冲到了白号角沙滩。"
589,"We first thought it was an isolated\nincident, but the same fate's been\nmet by every other ship since.","起初大家以为那只是个不幸的意外，\n可是从那天起，所有的船只\n都遭遇到了同样的事情……"
590,"That's how the Stormwall got its start.\nAnd now, we Esterians are pretty much\ntrapped here!","那就是岚之结界的开端。\n艾斯塔里亚的人被孤立在岛上\n一步都无法离开。"
592,"Most people have just kind of resigned\nthemselves to their fate. But me? I'm\ntoo stubborn for that!","现在几乎所有的人都放弃了。\n……但是我可受不了这种事。"
593,"When the Stormwall appeared, monsters\ncame with it.","在岚之结界出现的同时，\n魔物也开始在艾斯塔里亚出现。"
594,"That's what attacked you that day on the\nbeach. We call that particular species\n'Rheboll.'","攻击你的野狗也是其中的一种。\n人们都称它为『利波鲁』。"
596,"Monsters first appeared on the road\nup to the mountain, but they began\nattacking the villages soon after.","魔物最初也只是在山路上游荡，\n但很快，它们就开始袭击村庄了。"
597,"Barbado in particular was hit pretty\nbadly.",我们巴尔巴多这里受害特别严重。
598,"Minea seemed just as vulnerable, but\nthey've got that wall around them, so\nthey're much more secure.","米内亚那里的危险程度也不亚于这里，\n但是那里有坚固的城墙保护，\n至少在里面可以安心地生活。"
599,"Zepik was spared, too, somehow.\nSupposedly kept the monsters out\nwith some kinda mystical bell.","塞皮克村的防御设施只有栅栏，\n不知为什么，魔物就是不敢靠近那。\n传说是因为有个不可思议的铃在保护着村子。"
601,"We have nothing of the sort here,\nthough, so we have to take up arms\nand defend the town ourselves.","……我们这里什么都没有。\n自己的城镇只能靠自己来保护。\n我们能做的就只有这个了吧？"
603,"You... You've got an iron will, man. You\nmay be just what we need!",不过，你也真是相当鲁莽啊。
604,"The Stormwall has claimed so many\nlives...and it needs to stop!",竟然拿性命来挑战岚之结界……
605,"I assume you're looking to travel all\nthroughout Esteria, no?","你该不会是打算\n环游艾斯塔里亚各地吧？"
606,"That's...a really bad idea. You'll\nbe eaten by monsters for sure. No\ngood can come of it!","我劝你……最好不要。\n被魔物攻击的下场是很惨的。"
607,"...Why not join the town militia\ninstead? You've sure got the guts\nfor it!","……比起那个，你看怎么样？\n要不要加入我们的自卫队？\n我看你也是个很有胆识的人……"
608,"Adol explained that he wanted to\nconfirm Esteria's current state\nwith his own eyes.","亚特鲁表明了自己\n想到各地确认实际情况的想法。"
609,"...Yeah, I figured. I know your type.\nI doubt I could ever change your mind.","……我明白了。\n唉，看来你已经打定主意了啊。"
610,"You're a wild one, for sure. Takes\nnothing short of a miracle to make\nit through the Stormwall alive.","你真的很了不起。\n竟然可以穿越岚之结界，\n这可真是个奇迹啊。"
611,"This...is my place. I know that. But\nit's not yours. No, destiny's got bigger\nthings in mind for you, definitely!","这是我的直觉……我觉得\n有一个神奇的命运在等待着你。"
612,"Anyway, when you leave here, go north.\nWe're just a hop, skip and a jump away\nfrom #02Minea.","……首先，你从巴尔巴多出发一路向北走。\n不多久，就能看到#02米内亚镇#00的城墙了。"
613,"Minea is Esteria's largest city. You're\nsure to find some useful information\nthere.","米内亚是艾斯塔里亚最大的城镇。\n你一定能在那里打听到你想知道的消息。"
614,"Oh, yeah...and take this with you.",对了……你拿上这个。
617,"Consider it a parting gift. All of us\nmilitants carry these. They're small,\nbut they get the job done!","算是我送给你的饯别礼。\n这是我们自卫队用的东西，\n虽然小巧，但是很好用。"
618,"Haven't got much in the way of armor,\nbut there's a good shop for that in\nMinea. Be sure to stop by when you can!","至于防具，很遗憾目前没多余的了。\n米内亚那里有家防具专卖店，\n你可以等赚到钱以后再去采购。"
620,"...Take care. And if you come around\nagain, drop in!","……那就再见啦。\n偶尔也要过来露个脸哦。"
622,"Take care, Adol. Be sure to stop by if\nyou're ever in town again!","保重啦，亚特鲁。\n再来巴尔巴多时，要来露个脸哦。"
624,"All right. Well, you be sure to come\nback sometime!",是吗，下次还要再来哦。
626,"Adol... It's pretty cold of you to leave\nwithout even saying goodbye.","亚特鲁……\n你这样一声不吭就离开巴尔巴多，\n未免也太见外了吧。"
627,"Still, you're feeling better, so I'll\noverlook it...this time.","不过，看到你这么有精神，\n我就安心了。"
631,"Next time, though, you'd better drop in\nbefore you go, or I'll bust you up!",偶尔也来我这里露个脸嘛。
633,"You've been all over Esteria, it seems.\nAnything new to report?","听说你走遍了艾斯塔里亚各地。\n怎么样，有什么进展吗？"
638,"Hey, you seem well. How's Esteria\nlooking?","嗨，你看起来气色不错嘛。\n怎么样，艾斯塔里亚的情况如何？"
640,"If there's ever anything troubling you,\nfeel free to come on by.","有什么困难，随时都可以来找我。\n说不定我可以帮上一点忙。"
642,"Well, now, if it isn't Adol! So what's\nthe story? Learn anything out there?","嗨，这不是亚特鲁嘛。\n有发生什么特殊的事吗？"
643,"What's wrong? You look positively\ndrained! Did something happen to\nyou?","怎么了，你的表情这么严肃……\n到底发生什么事情了？"
644,"Adol told Slaff about the monsters\nhe'd been fighting, and the events\nleading up to these battles.","亚特鲁把巨大魔物的出现\n等一连串的事情都告诉给了斯拉夫。"
645,"Yeah, my men tell me something is\ndefinitely happening to Minea...and\nwhatever it is, it's no good at all!","我听队里的人说，\n米内亚那里好像出事了。"
646,"Do you know anything more specific about\nwhat's going on out there, Adol?","亚特鲁……\n你知道详情的话，\n能告诉我吗？"
647,"Adol told Slaff all about the recent\nchain of events.","亚特鲁向斯拉夫\n讲述了发生的一连串的事情。"
648,"He explained that he was searching\nfor the Books of Ys, and told of\nhis odd experience in the shrine.","包括他在寻找『伊苏之书』，\n以及在神殿里的奇特经历……"
649,Wow. It's like some kind of fairy tale!,"嗯~……\n这简直就像是童话的世界。"
650,"First the Stormwall, now this...\nAre we in a magical fantasy land,\nbuilt for someone's amusement?!","还有那个岚之结界……\n这个国家到底发生了什么情况啊？"
651,"Ehh, either way... You've got a\nheaping helping of destiny on your\nplate, Adol. Eat up, I say!","不过……我的直觉的确没错，\n迎接你的果然是不可思议的命运。"
654,"...Actually, will you follow me for a\nmoment?","……亚特鲁，你有时间吗？\n麻烦跟我来一下。"
656,"Here. Take this sword with\nyou.",亚特鲁，收下这把剑吧。
658,"I found it while patrolling\nat Whitehorn Beach, six\nmonths ago.","……这是半年前，\n在巡逻白号角沙滩时，\n在海滩上捡到的。"
659,"Probably from a trade ship capsized\nby the Stormwall. Which means they\nwon't miss it, so don't feel bad!","我想应该是被卷入岚之结界的\n商船上的东西吧。"
660,"I think it came from one of the\ncountries in the east. The curved\nblade gives it a distinctive feel.","看起来像是一把来自东方的剑。\n弯曲的刀刃锋利无比，\n不过用起来难度很高。"
661,"I think you'll make good use of it.\nHope it comes in handy fighting all\nthose monsters!","我想你用起来一定能得心应手的。\n希望它能在你与魔物的战斗中派上用场。"
662,"Ha... It's weird, you know? Seeing\nthat determined look in your eyes,\nI almost want to go with you...","呵呵……这感觉还真奇怪。\n看到你如此积极的生活态度，\n莫名地让我想要为你加油。"
665,"Ah, well. I'll see you later, man.\nIf you need anything else, don't\nyou hesitate to swing by!","……那么就这样啦。\n有事的话，再到仓库来找我吧。"
667,"Keep at it, Adol. You just might be able\nto solve the mysteries of this land!","亚特鲁，加油啊。\n搞不好你可以为大家解开\n这个被诅咒的艾斯塔里亚之谜。"
670,"Adol told Slaff that he was headed to\nDarm Tower.","亚特鲁告诉斯拉夫\n自己将要进入达姆之塔的打算。"
671,"...I see. You're going to the Devil's\nTower, are you?","……是吗？\n你要去那座『恶魔之塔』啊……"
672,"Well...you look up to the task, at\nleast. Much better than when you\nfirst washed ashore, at any rate!","不过……亚特鲁。\n你现在的神情非常棒。\n嗯，真的……就像变了个人一样。"
673,"Thought you were just some headstrong\nkid back then. But I know better now!","一开始我以为你只是个\n血气方刚的普通少年而已……\n现在，你的眼神沉着而坚定。"
675,"I guess I've said all I can. Only thing\nleft to do is wish you luck!",我已经没什么建议可以给你的了。
676,"You should go and find us the truth\nbehind all these calamities. I know\nyou can do it.","你就用那双眼睛去好好地看清楚\n艾斯塔里亚所发生异变的真相吧。"
678,"Just be sure you come back alive...\nor I'll kill you!",你一定……要回来哦！
680,"I guess I've said all I can. Only thing\nleft to do is wish you luck!",我已经没什么建议可以给你的了。
681,"You should go and find us the truth\nbehind all these calamities. I know\nyou can do it.","你就用那双眼睛去好好地看清楚\n艾斯塔里亚所发生异变的真相吧。"
