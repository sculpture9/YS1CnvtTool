2605,"Oh, hey...I hate to ask, but if you\nDO go see Raba, would you please\ntake this Idol to him?","啊，不好意思，请你顺便\n把这个偶像拿去交给拉巴。"
2606,"He must've dropped it at some point.\nAnd without it, he's totally exposed\nto the monsters!",老爷子说他没了这东西会很困扰的。
2607,"We'll talk later. For now, just try\nto stay alive. You never know where\nthe monsters are lurking.","详情以后再说，赶快走吧。\n魔物随时都可能出现的。"

2615,"Hey! There's no one here! ...Wait,\nare you using the Idol? Damn it,\nman, cut that out! ","哦！一个人都没有！\n……喂，你用偶像隐身了吗？\n拜托，现在不是玩的时候吧！？"
2618,"So, yeah. It's me, Dogi. Saving\nyour hide, yet again!","嗨，又见面啦。\n是我，多奇啦。"
2619,"Seems you've got a knack for\ngetting into trouble. But at\nleast you're doin' stuff, I guess!","你这样到处活跃着，\n居然还能平安无事。"
2620,"So, I've gotta ask... What the\nhell are you doing in this tower\nto begin with?!","对了，你……\n为什么要到这么危险的地方来？"
2621,"Adol explained his reasons\nfor infiltrating the tower.","亚特鲁向多奇说明了\n自己进入这座塔的原因。"
2622,"Okay. So you came here to get your\njollies, and wound up with more\nthan you bargained for. I gotcha.","……原来是这样。\n你已经见过古邦老大啦。"

2626,"I'm helping him scout out the\ntower, to return the favor.","为了报答他，我留在这里协助调查，\n结果就错过了回去的时机。"
2628,"Might as well, you know? I mean,\nI'm here. And I hate leaving a\nplace without tearing it up first!","不过看样子……\n该是离开这里的时候了。"
2631,"Anyway...there's a rod somewhere\naround here that's designed just\nlike that Crystal you've got.","话说回来……你拿着的那个水晶，\n我有见到过一根用同样的水晶做装饰的法杖。"
2632,"From what I hear, you'll need\nit to get to the top floor.","听说要去塔的上层的话，\n那根法杖是不可或缺的。"
2633,"Heard about it from the boss'\nmom. And when she tells you\nsomethin', you don't question it!","……这是以前我从\n老大的妈妈那听说的。"
2635,"But man, Adol, you're amazing. You\nbeen here, what, a few days? And\nlook what all you've accomplished!","不过，亚特鲁……\n你看起来真的很努力。"
2636,"If you need my help with anything,\nyou just say the word. Heavy stuff\nis my forte. Walls, in particular.","有需要我帮忙的事就尽管说。\n干力气活儿可是我最擅长的哦。"

2639,"I'll carry all the wounded in here\nto the bottom floor, no sweat!","知道了，受伤的那些人\n我会负责把他们背到出口的。"
2640,"Don't worry, I haven't forgotten\nabout that girl in Rado's Annex.\nShe'll be safe. Just leave it to me!","还有在拉朵之塔的那个女孩，\n我也会把她带去出口的。"
2641,"The tower's head honcho is in your\nhands, man. Give him hell!","所以，你就放心地\n去打败塔顶的那个黑幕吧。"
2643,"Just make sure you don't die on\nme in here, Adol.",听着……你绝不能死哦！
2644,"...I'll carry all the wounded\nto the exit, no sweat. You can\ncount on me!","……受伤的那些人\n我会负责把他们背到出口的。"
2646,That rod...,那根法杖是……
2647,"That may be the rod that Goban's\nmom was always going on about.","老大的妈妈所说的\n应该就是那根法杖了。"
2648,"Should be all you need to make it\nto the top floor of this tower!","如果你拿着这东西，\n我想应该就能到塔的上层去了。"
2649,"But I'll bet the monsters just\nget more and more vicious the\nhigher up you go.","不过，上层很可能\n有更难对付的魔物。"
2650,"So take care of yourself, man.\nAin't no one to hear you scream\nfrom all the way up there...",你一定要多加小心啊。
2653,"Oh, it's you...",嗨，是你啊……
2654,"The monsters got me, and shut me\nin here for some reason. Can't\nbelieve I let my guard down!","不好意思，我被魔物发现了，\n把我关在了这里。"
2655,"They broke my Idol, too. So no\nmore turning invisible...","那个偶像也……\n被魔物打碎了。"
2656,"What do you mean, run? That's the\nDevil's Corridor out there! That\neerie humming can kill a man!","要我赶快逃？\n你不知道『恶魔回廊』的机关吗？\n那个声音会侵蚀人类的生命。"
2658,"You're young and strong...but I'm\na weak old man. I'd never make it!","像你这样的年轻人还可以，\n我这把老骨头根本就跑不动。"
2659,"Though, you do look rather pale\nright now. Why not rest here for\na moment?","而且，你的脸色也不太好。\n我看你还是稍微休息一下吧。"
2660,"That devilish music is caused\nby the wind, I surmise. It's\nreally rather cleverly designed.","那个恶魔的旋律是一种\n利用外面的风来吹响的机关。"
2661,"It's like a pipe organ. I think the\nwind's being fed through#02 one of the\npillars on the balcony.","所以，#02外面的柱子有一根#00\n应该就是把风引进来的通风管。"
2662,"If we could figure out which one,\nwe could bust it with a hammer or\nsomething, and stop the music.","破坏掉那根柱子的话，\n应该就不会再响了……"
2666,"Adol...? It's me, Luta Gemma.","亚特鲁先生……\n是我，卢达・洁玛。"
2667,"I was hiding out with Raba, but\nthe monsters located us.","我在去找拉巴老人的途中，\n不幸被魔物们发现了……"

2669,"Oh, don't worry. It's nowhere\nnear as bad as it looks. I just\nhave to stay off of it for a bit.","我没事的……\n伤势并没有看起来那么严重。"
2670,"I heard from the old man that a\nyoung girl was taken into the\nannex.","我听那个老人说，\n好像有个少女被带到了这座塔里。"
2672,"I don't like the sound of that\none bit. Please, Adol... Go and\nrescue her!","我有种不祥的预感。\n拜托你，请去救救那个女孩。"
2675,"Adol, please go rescue the girl\nwho was brought into the annex.","亚特鲁先生，求你了。\n请去救救被带到\n这座塔里的那位少女。"
2676,"The girl is safe? Oh,\nthank goodness...","太好了……\n她没什么大碍吧？"
2678,"It's really quite odd. I've never\nmet that girl before, yet I'm\nabsolutely terrified for her...","不过说来奇怪，我并不认识她，\n为什么会这么在意那个姑娘呢？\n……我自己也觉得不可思议。"
2681,"On another note... Those books\nyou've got tucked away, there...","对了，你带着的\n那本皮质封面的书……"
2682,"They look a great deal like the\nold book that's been passed down\nin my family for generations.","我曾经在我家看到过\n一本和它相似的书。"
2684,"Unfortunately, I lost it when\nI was just a boy.",不过现在已经不见了……
2687,Wait... Is that...?,啊，那本皮质封面的书是……
2688,"Why do you have the Book of Gemma?!\nThat's my family's ancestral album!","你为什么会有『洁玛之章』？\n那是我的祖先所写的书。"
2689,"I lost it when I was a little boy,\nand have always wondered where it\nmay have gotten to...","那本书在我很小的时候就遗失了，\n怎么找都找不到。"
2690,"Back then, my father told\nme something...","……很久以前，\n我曾听家父这样说过。"
2691,"He said that the one who found all\nsix Books of Ys would be granted\nthe power to bring peace to Esteria.","他说集齐六本伊苏之书的人，\n将获得为这片土地带来和平的力量……"
2692,...Adol.,……亚特鲁先生。
2694,"This is another ancient heirloom\npassed down in my family. And I'd\nlike for you to have it.","这是我家自古以来代代相传的物品。\n请你收下吧。"
2697,"My leg is a bit worse\nthan I'd previously\nthought...",脚上的伤比我预想的还要严重……
2698,"My leg is a bit worse than I'd\npreviously thought...but it does\nfeel better now than it did earlier.","脚上的伤比我预想的还要严重。\n虽然已经舒服些了，不过……"
2699,"I think I'll stay here, in safety,\nand rest for a bit longer. I'll be\nfine. You have to go, right?","我可能暂时无法行动了。\n别管我，你先走吧。"
2700,"Don't you worry about me.\nOnce my leg's stopped throbbing,\nI'll make my way out of here.","我不会有事的。\n总会有办法的。"
2701,"Adol...? It's me, Luta Gemma.","亚特鲁先生……\n是我，卢达・洁玛。"
2702,"I was hiding out with Raba, but\nthe monsters located us.","我在去找拉巴老人的途中，\n不幸被魔物们发现了……"
