2550,"If I've got it figured right, then\nsomething akin to the Stormwall\nappeared on the day Ys was lost.","……根据少数记录了伊苏消失的文献记载，\n当时也出现了类似于『岚之结界』的现象。"
2551,"Storms encircled the island, and\nwhen they were gone, so was Ys. All\nthat remained was this here tower.","当长达数年的岚之结界消失后，\n『伊苏』就完全失去了踪影，\n荒芜的大地上只留下了高耸入云的巨塔。"

2556,"But the danger was still there.\nIt was dormant...but it was there.","……但是灾难，\n并没有真正结束。"
2557,"You sense it, too, don't you? As we\nspeak, someone in this tower is\nsetting something evil in motion.","你应该也能感觉到吧？\n现在这座塔，受到了人为的控制。"
2558,"There are traps everywhere around\nhere. Without a doubt, someone or\nsomething is puppeteering it all.","被统率的魔物士兵，以及邪恶的机关陷阱……\n毫无疑问，背后一定有人在操纵着。"
2560,"To what end, though, I have no\nidea. But we can't just let it\nhappen, can we?","他的目的究竟是什么……\n这正是我们要去查明的。"
2562,"...Of course, that's why you're\nhere, though. So, you intend to\nkeep climbing this tower, do you?","……话说回来，\n你打算继续这样探索下去吗？"
2563,"In that case, I think you should\nhave this.",那你把这个东西带上吧。
2566,"As long as you're wearing the Blue\nNecklace, the tower's many booby\ntraps will be totally ineffective.","那条项链有驱魔的力量。\n它能保护你不会误中邪恶的陷阱。"
2567,"Now, if you'll excuse me...I have\na few things I need to ponder. You\ngo on ahead, all right?","……不好意思。\n让我安静地思考一会儿。"
2568,"When Adol came to, he found\nhimself locked in a prison\ncell.","亚特鲁回过神时，\n已经在牢房里了。"
