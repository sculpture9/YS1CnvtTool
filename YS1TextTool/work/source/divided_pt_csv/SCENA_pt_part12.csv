1639,"It's fortunate for us\nthat they never venture\noutside. Word is, they\ncan't stand daylight.","幸好矿山里的魔物不会到外面来。\n有人说那里的魔怪害怕阳光照射。"
1640,"But listen to me, warning\na stranger not to set foot\nin a place no sane man\nwould dare enter anyway...","我想应该没人会有事\n要去那个地方的吧。"
1642,"The mine is pitch black,\nand hard to navigate on\naccount of the haphazard\ntunnel structure.","矿山里面一片漆黑，而且结构复杂。\n这是当初随意挖掘开采银矿的结果。"
